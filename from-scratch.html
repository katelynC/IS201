        <p>One thing that not many people know about me is that I've only read one fanfiction novel. However, it's the best fanfiction novel I've ever read-- No, scratch that, it's actually one of my favorite novels I've ever read! This is a fanfiction of the "Harry Potter" series written by Eliezer Yudkowsky, who generally writes on decision theory and ethics. In his take of "Harry Potter," Yudkowsky presents a Harry Potter raised by loving parents, and in particular, a scientist father. When Harry is introduced to the magical world, he approaches it with the skepticism and rationality of a scientist. With this mindset firmly in hand, we get to experience the world of Hogwarts with Harry, Hermione, and Draco in a whole new way! Defense Against the Dark Arts class becomes a war between armies of first-year students led by Harry, Hermione, and Draco; Harry branches into exploring new magics and tries to corrupt Draco to "The Light Side"; and all of Harry's adventures with Voldemort (not to mention Harry's plots to conquer death and save the world) progress within just his first year at Hogwarts. Enter this new world to see the adventures which transpire as Harry wields the Methods of Rationality!</p>

        <p>My favorite show as of late is the Netflix series "Our Planet." I love to fall asleep while watching these episodes! Available on both YouTube and Netflix, it's a real treat; you get to see the most beautiful aspects of nature in high definition, through some of the most breathtaking landscaping and animal photography I've ever seen, while relaxing to an incredible soundtrack and listening to the calming narration of David Attenborough. What more can you ask for?!</p>
        <p>Some of my other favorite movie and TV genres include...</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Comedy movies! When you can even make a movie classified within a certain genre while making fun of that genre... To me, this is true mastery. (Plus, it's just great to have something to watch as you relax, and which isn't too mentally taxing.) For example:
                <ul>
                    <li>Hot Rod</li>
                    <li>The Princess Bride</li>
                    <li>Central Intelligence (with Dwayne Johnson)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Cop shows! They are so fun to watch, and it's even better if they include humor. Some of my faves from this genre include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Psych</li>
                    <li>The Mentalist</li>
                    <li>Brooklyn 99</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
